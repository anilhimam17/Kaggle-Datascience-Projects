# Digit - Recogniser | Version - 1

- This is my first machine learning project submission of Kaggle.
- This project is concerned with recognising hand written digits using a `Linear TensorFlow Deep Learning Model`.
- In this project I `havent used CNN's` for the sake of simplicity.
- Open to constructive criticism if any on making the model any better ðŸ™‚.

## Dataset for the project

- The dataset used in the notebook is available using the following command
